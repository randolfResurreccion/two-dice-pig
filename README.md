# two-dice-pig
Pig is a simple dice game also known as "jeopardy dice games". 

This variation is the same as Pig, except:

1. Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
2. If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
3. If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
